##This repo is code for my portfolio.

You can find it at [portfolio.hypersprite.com](http://portfolio.hypersprite.com), which is gh-pages with a Cname redirect for the hypersprite.com domain. Other than that domain registration, everything on this site is free of charge, free of bootstrap (or other CSS framework), free of jQuery or anything else. So I didn't take the easy way out on this one.

###Feature list:

 - Twitter profile style.
 - Responsive for various browser sizes.
 - Parallax background scrolling effect.
 - Scroll and lock navigation bar.
 - Email contact form with submit status bar.
 - Content loaded with JavaScript via JSON file and XHR request.
 - Content filter links and category item count.

###Todo:

* JavaScript email input validation and message boxes.
* Testing with IE/Edge.
*  Work on phone landscape mode.
