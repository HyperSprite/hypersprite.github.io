#JSPlaygrounds by Stephen Grider

>If you are interested in React development, check out Steven Grider's work on [RallyCoding](http://rallycoding.com/). He also has a number of good video courses on Udemy.

The JSPlaygrounds project is located [here](https://github.com/StephenGrider/JSPlaygrounds).

This is here because I wanted to work offline on localhost with all local assets (airplane mode).

Using http-server, cd into the ```jsplaygrounds``` directory and run ```http-server```. Now point your browser to **localhost:8080**.

This is a React app, so if you look at index.html, you can see that there is not much html, everything you see is brought in via the bundle.js file which is built by Webpack using Babel from ES2015 code.
