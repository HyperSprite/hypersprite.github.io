The point was to make it easier to use the tool as the equipment is received and installed because, the reality is, nobody has time to go back and documents things.<br>I designed it using three main collections, Locations, Assets and Systems. This allows equipment to be treated as commodity while not loosing what makes each System unique. It has Search and Reporting capabilities that allow data to be easily exported and utilized by other departments. <br><br>It currently uses:<br>Node.js and Express for the server and includes such npm packages such as Passport, Moment.js and many more<br>Mongodb and Mongoose for data storage and models<br>Front end is primarily server rendered templates using Handlebars, Bootstrap and jQuery<br><br>For the future,  I hope to move to a React front end to allow for easier customization of the configuration output scripts."
