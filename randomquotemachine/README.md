#FreeCodeCamp: Random Quote Machine Project


----------

One of the hardest parts of this project was finding a quotes API that gave out more than one quote a day for free. In the end I just scraped [Wikiquote.org](https://www.wikiquote.org/) Anonymous page and removed as many offensive quotes as I could find.

For the background I used [Unsplash](http://www.unsplash.com) which has reliably lovely but totally random.

Features:

* No JavaScript or CSS library
* Gets quote array via XHR
* Has a link to refresh the quote without refreshing the page
* Has a link to tweet about the current quote
* Random background image
* Dynamic text size based on quote
