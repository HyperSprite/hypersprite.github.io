#HyperSprite themes

Sometimes you can't find what you want out there. There are a million themes for text editors etc. and they all seem the same to me. A little while back I started working on a theme for Sublime Text that met some of my priorities:

* I wanted it dark, having a screen glaring at me all day was not helpful.
* I wanted to be able to read comments. I can't tell you how many editors show comments in some barely readable color.
* I wanted it to be dark red.

##Theme types in this repo:`

* Sublime Text
* HilightJS
* Atom

For a sample, see the Highlightjs demo here https://www.rcrsv.com/highlightjs/
